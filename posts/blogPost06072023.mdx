# Meeting with Kristi:

- Thoughts on the Idea
- Get advice on how to atttract more venues
- Issues of working with a larger organization
- User experince with booking a venue

## Thoughts

- Likes the idea not sure that it would work
- Thinks there are more steps I am missing
- Doesn't think businesses will pay up front

## Growth

- Would start smaller breweries
- Get in with the social orgs to help increase adoption
- avoid promoters and companies till it is better fleshed out

## Dealing with a larger client like hotels

- Not ready as they have contracts and food etc.
- Feels like most just need a reservation not a fee
- Will expect to be able to intergrate with their systems

## Advice on the booking side

- start smaller
- look at breweries and happy hour spots
- handle messaging better(messaging interface needs to be more robust) group by users inside of venues
