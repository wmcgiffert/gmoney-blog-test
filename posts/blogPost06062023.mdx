# What was announced at WWDC 2023

- IpadOS 17
- Journal App
- WatchOS ?
- AppleVison / AppleAR headset

## Thoughts

Most everything that was annoucned was a solid updates but mostly bringing features to new platforms. However the AppleAR headset is exetremely impressive. It starts at $3,500.00 and it definitely comes with an early adopter tax. All that being said it hass to be one of the most exciting apple products I have seen in half a decacde.

## Why is the AppleAR headset so exciting?

This mostly comes down to the fact that apple looks to do what they have always done best, provide the best user experince possible. The intergration into their ecosystem is going to be second to none, and provides the best use cases for things other than AR/VR games. The headset is going to be able to provide a new way to interact with the world around you.
