# Transaltion Dashboard: 
- Asked to scope the feature
- Endpoints needed:
    - GetAll
    - GetById
    - Post
    - PutById
    - Delete
- UI requirements:
    - Read Lables
        -Labels are Keys without a value 
    - Post 
        - Must validate that record doesn't exist first
    - Put 
        - Must validate that record exist first
    - Delete
        - Must validate that record exist first
# Daily work accomplished today:
- Code clean up
    - GetAll
        - Be more careful with naming and when copy pasting endpoints be sure to change the call. 
        - Culprit: Copy Paste
        - Instead of copy pasting try rewriting it so that you catch all the code that needs to change.
    - Put
        - Be more careful about function names and that they refer to what is going on
        - Culprit: Copy Paste
        - See above solution ^

# Things to follow up on:

- The Socialbooking
    - Contact more venues
    - Offer walk-throughs and config appointments
- Reading (Cracking the Coding Interview)
- Al's Project
- Brenda Demonbreon Website
- Matt H project follow up
- Matt R follow up on business deal  

# Accomplishments & Learnings:

- More front-end experince
- Was a lot more involved in the planning phase of how to solve the issues 
    - "Less do this" and more "Hey this is our issue how would you solve it"
